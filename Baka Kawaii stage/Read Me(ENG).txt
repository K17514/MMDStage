バカ可愛いステージ/Baka Kawaii Stage

This stage is a 3D version of the illustration of the Iなんです(I am you) in Project Sekai 2DMV.
Using Ray-MMD or other shaders is recommended cause it looks ugly without extra lightings.

Online read me has priority so check the online version first.


<Forbidden matters>
1. Don't use in game. (e.g. VRChat)
2. Don't use for commercial, religious, political purpose.
3. Don't make R-18, R-18G contents with my model.
4. Don't redistribute the model regardless of edit.
5. Don't upload my model in public format that others can use (e.g. VR world, Niconi Solid)


You can use my stage in other 3DCG software (like b3d, c4d, unity, etc) for cloth simulation video.
Editing is OK, but don't redistribute it.
Always credit me (NNGN).

I'll not take responsibility for any problems caused by using my data. Use at your own risk.
If you have any questions please tell me.
Thanks for reading.
