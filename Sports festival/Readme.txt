Hello everyone!

So while looking through the files of the 3DS games (thanks GBAtemp!), I found some interesting stages^^
So here you have the other one, the Sports festival stadium!
It is in pmx format for the outline and something I tried with the fire^^

Model was ripped, ported and edited from My Hero Academia: Battle for All by Emidikun (thanks again GBAtemp!)
Just as always, I waifu2x'd the textures!^^

Edit all you want! (but please don't forget to credit^^)
That's all!^^
Cheers!
